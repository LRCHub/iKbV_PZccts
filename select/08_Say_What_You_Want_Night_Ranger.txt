Heading down on the freeway
Feeling all the heat of the sunshine
Rolling down the window
Singing all my favorite songs
Only one way I get here
Think about the meaning of something
That's how we gonna do it
Yeah we gonna do it right
Right right right right right oh yeah

Say what you want but I won't go away
I'll be around whatever you say
Tell me a lie and I'm good for the day

All the winners keep a winning
Losers getting ready for nothing
Tell me tell me tell me
Where you gonna fall in line
Oh yeah you got a habit
Of taking out whatever's a good thing
Find yourself a hammer
Smash it up and do it right
Right right right right right oh yeah

Say what you want but I won't go away
I'll be around whatever you say
Tell me a lie and I'm good for the day

Telephone is ringing
I can't stop drinking
Here I am hanging out with nothing to do
I don't want to hear it
I need another hit off
Of you yeah yeah

Well look who's backing down
Anytime anywhere anyhow
There's nothing left in this old town
Yeah yeah yeah

Say what you want but I won't go away
I'll be around whatever you say
Tell me a lie and I'm good for the day

No I won't go away
