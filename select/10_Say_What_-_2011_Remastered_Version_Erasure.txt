Say what, make out
Say what, make out

It's a crazy situation
Keeps my body hot
I want infatuation
Something you ain't got
This fire inside
A love so bright

Say what
The hell you think you've done
A-drive me higher and higher
Make out (make out)
When nothing's going on
Oh you're such a liar

I got no future
What's the use in keeping tight
Always wrapped up in yourself
Oh you're alright
Why should I fall
No love at all

Mama said you're as good as dead
If you don't polish up yourself
(Love don't come either)

Say what
Love, love, love
(Love don't come either)
Make out

Why'd you try to fool me
I see, got no heart
A-threw me tried to rue me
Tore my head apart
See your lover move on
See right from wrong

Mama said you're as good as dead
If you don't polish up yourself
